## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Quality
- ✅ **Real-time data** from Baseball Savant
- ✅ **Event-based windows** (not game-based)
- ✅ **Comprehensive histograms** for quality metrics
- ✅ **Full datasets** for reliable analysis

### Adjustment System Integration
```python
# Example adjustment calculation
def calculate_adjustment(player_data):
    recent_xwoba = player_data['rolling_windows']['50']['summary']['latest_xwoba']
    avg_xwoba = player_data['rolling_windows']['50']['summary']['avg_xwoba']

    # Weight recent performance more heavily
    adjustment_factor = (recent_xwoba - avg_xwoba) * 1.5  # 50% boost to recent trend

    return adjustment_factor
```

### Platform Considerations
- **DraftKings**: Power-focused scoring (HR = 14 points)
- **FanDuel**: Stack correlation focus
- **Adjustments**: Weight recent performance trends accordingly

---

## Production Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Collection**: Super aggressive mode (16 workers, 0.1s delay)
2. **Processing**: Real-time rolling windows calculation
3. **Adjustment**: Weight recent performance vs historical average
4. **Integration**: Apply to SaberSim median projections
5. **Output**: Platform-specific CSV files (dk_upload.csv, fd_upload.csv)

### Performance Metrics
- **Collection Speed**: ~1560 players in seconds
- **Data Freshness**: Real-time from Baseball Savant
- **Reliability**: Hash-based change detection
- **Scalability**: Event-based windows scale with player activity

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with win_calc module**
2. **Apply adjustments to SaberSim projections**
3. **Generate platform-specific outputs**
4. **Implement real-time updates**
