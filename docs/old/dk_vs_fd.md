# DraftKings vs FanDuel MLB: Complete Platform Comparison

## Executive Summary

Transitioning from DraftKings to FanDuel in Major League Baseball (MLB) Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) requires a fundamental shift in approach, driven primarily by distinct scoring mechanisms, roster construction, and strategic implications for player valuation, pitching roles, and hitting correlations.

While SaberSim's comprehensive simulation data provides an unparalleled advantage for both platforms, its application must be tailored to FanDuel's unique environment. The "edge" on FanDuel often lies in mastering the single-pitcher format, optimizing for higher-leverage hitting statistics, and adapting stack constructions to capitalize on FanDuel's specific scoring multipliers.

**Key Insight**: FanDuel is not merely a simplified version of DraftKings; it represents a different strategic challenge. Success hinges on a deep understanding of its unique economic model, encompassing scoring and roster requirements, and how simulation data can be leveraged to exploit these differences for maximum return on investment (ROI).

## Strategic Implications

### Pitching Strategy: The Single-Pitcher Paradigm

FanDuel's single pitcher slot fundamentally changes risk management:

- **Concentrated Variance**: One pitcher's performance has magnified impact
- **Quality Start Bonus**: +4 points for 6+ IP with ≤3 ER incentivizes durability
- **Higher Win Value**: +6 points vs +4 on DK makes team win probability crucial
- **Workhorse Focus**: Pitchers who go deep with high K-rates are extremely valuable

**Example**: A pitcher with 7 IP, 8 K, Win, and QS scores **55 points on FD** vs ~35.75 on DK

### Hitting & Stacking Strategy

FanDuel's scoring shifts optimal hitter profiles:

- **Power Premium**: HRs worth 20% more (12 vs 10 points)
- **Speed Premium**: SBs worth 20% more (6 vs 5 points)  
- **RBI/Run Premium**: 75% and 60% increases respectively
- **4-Player Stack Limit**: Forces 4-3 or 4-4 approaches vs DK's 5-player stacks

**Strategic Shift**: Focus on power-speed combination players and high-leverage lineup spots (2-5 hitters)

### Ownership & Contest Strategy

- **Different Chalk**: Players popular on DK may be less so on FD due to scoring differences
- **Leverage Opportunities**: Identify mispriced assets based on FD's scoring system
- **Contest Selection**: Use SaberSim's ROI insights for optimal contest mix

## Actionable Recommendations

### Phase 1: Platform Understanding
1. Internalize scoring differences and roster constraints
2. Understand single-pitcher risk concentration
3. Recognize 4-player stack limitations

### Phase 2: Player Valuation
1. Use SaberSim simulations specifically for FD
2. Identify players disproportionately rewarded on FD
3. Analyze optimal player pool builds sorted by ROI

### Phase 3: Stack Construction
1. Shift from 5-player to 4-3 or 4-4 stacks
2. Focus on correlated groups within constraints
3. Build lineups that "tell the story of the slate"

### Phase 4: Contest Optimization
1. Review ownership discrepancies between platforms
2. Find leverage spots unique to FD
3. Optimize contest selection based on ROI insights

### Phase 5: Late Swap Mastery
1. Be acutely aware of single pitcher news
2. Have pre-identified pivot options ready
3. Leverage rapid updates for concentrated impact

## SaberSim Integration

### Key Features for FD Success

1. **Contest Sims**: Optimize lineups for FD-specific ROI
2. **Custom Data**: Fine-tune based on FD nuances

## Conclusion

Success on FanDuel requires recognizing it as a distinct strategic challenge, not a simplified version of DraftKings. The key is leveraging SaberSim's comprehensive simulation capabilities while adapting to FD's unique scoring, roster, and stacking constraints. The single-pitcher format and 4-player stack limit create both challenges and opportunities for those who can master the platform's nuances.
